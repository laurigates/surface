summary: surf init / surf new — bootstrap a workspace and scaffold lint-clean hubs.

      new derives the target directory from the literal prefix of the first hub glob, then
      writes a hub with no anchors so it is lint-clean immediately; it refuses to overwrite.

# Scaffolding

`surf init` bootstraps the workspace (the one command that runs before discovery, since it
creates the marker); `surf new <name>` adds a templated hub under the configured directory.
