summary: The hub document format and the minimal-diff frontmatter editor used by verify.

  - claim: >
      A hub is a `---`-fenced YAML frontmatter block followed by a markdown body; `at:` is a
      scalar or a list, hash is optional until verified, and unknown fields (e.g. covers) are
      rejected.

      verify writes hashes back surgically: set_anchor_hash locates the Nth anchor item and
      replaces/inserts only its hash line, so an unchanged hash is byte-identical.

# Hub format

`parse_hub` is the contract everything binds to. Writes go through the line-level editor
(`set_anchor_hash` / `set_anchor_at`) rather than re-serializing, to keep diffs reviewable.
