summary: surf for — reverse lookup of hubs/claims anchored into a file; read-only query.
anchors:
  - claim: >
      run normalizes the queried path to workspace-root-relative form, then verifies it is a
      regular file on disk — a nonexistent/mistyped path, a directory, or a trailing slash errors
      (exit 1) rather than reporting "no hubs anchor", so a typo can't read as safe-to-edit. For a
      real file it finds the matching claims and prints them grouped by hub (human) or as a
      versioned {version, path, matches} envelope (JSON), always exiting 0 whether or not anything
      matched.

      find collects every claim whose anchored file equals the queried path (matched on path only —
      no source parse), optionally narrowed to anchors whose first segment is the given symbol.
      Malformed hubs are skipped rather than erroring, and results are sorted by hub then anchor.

# surf for

Delivers the discoverability half of the thesis: a fast way to pull up the claims governing a
file before touching its logic. `run` normalizes the queried path to workspace-root-relative form,
calls `find`, and prints matches grouped by hub (human) or as a versioned `{version, path,
matches}` envelope (JSON). No model, no network, no source parse — purely a read over the hub set.
